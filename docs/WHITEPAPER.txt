## Introduction
ARMPIT ($PITLAB) is an experimental meme-utility token built on the **Base chain**. Its mission: to support open hardware, DIY security, and the grassroots developer movement building the PitLab Wallet project.

---

## Purpose & Mission
The ARMPIT token exists to reward and support independent developers working to create open, secure, ARM-based crypto hardware. The meme is the movement — sweaty, honest, raw effort in the open.

---

## The Meme & The Machine
The “ARMPIT” name riffs on **ARM architecture + Pi hardware**, wrapped in the humor of self-reliance. It’s a joke that became a build — a sweatcoin for open devs.

---

## Tokenomics
- **Chain:** Base (EVM-compatible)
- **Standard:** ERC-20
- **Ticker:** PITLAB
- **Decimals:** 18
- **Supply:** 1,000,000,000 fixed
- **Distribution:** 100% Fair Launch — no presale, no team allocation, no VCs.
- **Contract:** Verified and open-source.
- **Liquidity:** LP burned on launch.

---

## Launch Model (Pure Fair-Launch)
ARMPIT will deploy using a **zero-tax, no-treasury** Base ERC-20 contract. LP tokens are burned post-launch to ensure full decentralization. The deployer walks away; the PIT stays alive through the community.

---

## Governance (Community-Led PITLAB)
Governance may emerge once a real contributor base forms. Until then, $PITLAB is governed by code and meme. Future proposals may include:
- Snapshot-based community voting.
- GitHub-linked grants.
- Open multisig for development funds.

---

## Roadmap & Ecosystem Vision
**Phase 0:** Fair Launch & LP Burn  
**Phase 1:** Build Awareness + Meme Growth  
**Phase 2:** Hardware Integration (PitLab Wallet + Base testing)  
**Phase 3:** Community Grants & Governance Activation  
**Phase 4:** Web3 Domain, IPFS Site, and Public Registry

---

## Security & Storage (Base + Trezor)
$PITLAB uses the ERC-20 standard, making it **Trezor-compatible** on Base (via MetaMask or hardware bridge).  
Solana-style SPL tokens are intentionally avoided to ensure hardware wallet support.

---

## Technical Overview
- **Smart Contract:** OpenZeppelin ERC-20 (modified for Base network)  
- **Deployment:** Hardhat / Foundry verified on BaseScan  
- **Hosting:** GitHub + IPFS mirror (static site)  
- **Dev Tools:** Node.js, Ethers.js, TailwindCSS, Markdown Docs

---

## Contribution & Support Model
ARMPIT encourages open collaboration — every holder is a backer. Contributions may include:
- GitHub pull requests (hardware/software)
- Meme creation or community moderation
- Technical documentation
- Donations to verified build addresses

---

## Legal & Disclaimer
This project is a **meme experiment**, not an investment. $PITLAB has no intrinsic monetary value, and no promises of profit are made. All code is open-source and use-at-your-own-risk.

---

## Contact / Links / Future
- **Website:** TBD (likely `pitlab.x` or `armpitcoin.x` hosted via IPFS)
- **GitHub:** [coming soon]
- **Docs:** `/docs/WHITEPAPER.md`
- **License:** MIT (open contribution model)

*Sweat together. Build together. The PIT never sleeps.*
